## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Frontend
cd client
npm install

# Backend
cd ../server
npm install
```

---

## 🔧 Development Scripts

### ▶️ Frontend (Vite)

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Starts Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173` (default).

### ▶️ Backend (Express)

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Runs Express server with Nodemon at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🏗️ Build for Production

### 🧱 Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

- Compiles TypeScript
- Bundles with Vite
- Output: `client/dist`

### 🧱 Backend

```bash
cd server
npm run build
```

- Compiles TypeScript
- Output: `server/dist` or configured `outDir`

---

## 👀 Preview Frontend Build

```bash
cd client
npm run preview
```

Serves the production build locally using Vite’s preview server.

---

## 🧹 Linting (Frontend)

```bash
cd client
npm run lint
```

Runs ESLint with strict rules and unused directive checks.

---

## 🌐 Deployment Tips

- Serve `client/dist` statically via Express or CDN.
- Run compiled backend with `node dist/index.js`.
- Use environment variables for config (`.env` support recommended).

---

## 💡 Bonus Tips

- Use [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) to run both servers in one terminal.
- Add proxy config in `vite.config.ts` to forward API calls to Express.
- Consider Dockerizing for consistent deployment.
